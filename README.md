# Flower-LargeModel-Tutorial

Welcome to the Flower-LargeModel-Tutorial, a comprehensive guide crafted to adeptly navigate you through utilizing the Flower federated learning framework for large-scale models, especially on resource-constrained devices.

This tutorial serves as the stepping stone towards adapting federated learning principles to handle larger models seamlessly, even when operating on devices with significant source constraints. 

## Preamble: Industrial Standard Repository

In light of the knowledge accumulated from this tutorial, we have derived an industrial-standard repository that revolutionizes the traditional approach to federated learning: [Flower-FL-Local-Training-Isolation-Framework](https://github.com/AIerLab/Flower-FL-Local-Training-Isolation-Framework). This repository is envisioned to be a beacon of innovation, setting a benchmark in the federated learning domain by separating the training process from the Flower framework, thus enabling the implementation of more sophisticated training methodologies without intervening with the core logic of the framework.

## Setup Guide

Before embarking on this tutorial, it is pivotal to set up your environment optimally. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Flower Framework**:
   
   Commence by installing the Flower framework, the cornerstone for your federated learning journey. Use the command below in your terminal:
   
   ```sh
   python -m pip install flwr 
   ```

2. **PyTorch**:

   Follow up with the installation of PyTorch, a versatile library that facilitates both machine and deep learning operations. Follow the guidelines in the official documentation for a smooth setup:
   
   ```sh
   python -m pip install torch torchvision
   ```

## Tutorial Flow

Our tutorial is designed to guide you step by step through the nuances of leveraging the Flower framework for federated learning on larger models and resource-constrained devices. Here, you'll learn the art of separating the model training process from the core framework, hence allowing the integration of intricate training methodologies without disturbing the fundamental logic of the Flower framework.

## Conclusion and Next Steps
